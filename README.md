# RPS-Multiplayer

GOAL - a rock paper scissors lizard spock (rock paper scissors variant) game that can be played by multiple people
	scoring is only accumulative for each person beaten.





STILL TO DO
	add ability to remove players from scoreboard on disconnect


BUGS
very rarely will update playerlist with undefined info
jQuery isn't happy with initialization of tooltip even though it works.
