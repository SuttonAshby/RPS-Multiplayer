# RPS-Multiplayer

GOAL - a rock paper scissors lizard spock (rock paper scissors variant) game that can be played by multiple people
	scoring is only accumulative for each person beaten.

	a chat button based chat system with random messages based on type to avoid
		potential inappropriate or toxic messaging




STILL TO DO
	add ability to remove players from scoreboard on disconnect
	hit enter to submit name
	user input validation
	ideally older players should not score a point off of the new player waiting to join next match
	ideally timer should be offset from the first time there are two players rather than irrespective of players
	some limiter on spamming messages
	increase chat options
	better information posts when player can't do something
	make it more mobile friendly


BUGS
very rarely will update playerlist with undefined info
very rarely the player count gets out of sync which can lead to the matches not starting
jQuery isn't happy with initialization of tooltip even though it works.
